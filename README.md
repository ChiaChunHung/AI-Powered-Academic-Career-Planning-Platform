## 🎯 Problem

MSBA students face **scattered resources** and **information overload** when planning their academic journey:

- 📚 **Vague course descriptions** → Students pick electives blindly
- 🎪 **Unclear workshop value** → Miss critical skill-building opportunities  
- 👥 **Ineffective alumni networking** → Waste time with no response
- ⏰ **Hours of trial-and-error** → Frustration and uncertainty

**Result:** Students know where they want to go, but don't know how to get there.
